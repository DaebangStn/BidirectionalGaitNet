## Final Directory Structure

### `surgery/` Directory (NEW) - Complete Surgery Module
```
surgery/
â”œâ”€â”€ CMakeLists.txt              # Builds surgery library + both executables
â”œâ”€â”€ SurgeryExecutor.h/cpp       # Base surgery operations (moved from sim/)
â”œâ”€â”€ SurgeryOperation.h/cpp      # Surgery operation classes (moved from viewer/)
â”œâ”€â”€ SurgeryScript.h/cpp         # Surgery script handling (moved from viewer/)
â”œâ”€â”€ SurgeryPanel.h/cpp          # GUI panel for surgery (moved from viewer/)
â”œâ”€â”€ PhysicalExam.h/cpp         # Physical examination app (moved from viewer/)
â”œâ”€â”€ physical_exam_main.cpp      # Physical exam entry point (moved from viewer/)
â””â”€â”€ surgery_main.cpp            # CLI surgery tool (moved from viewer/)
```

### `viewer/` Directory - Rendering & Visualization Only
```
viewer/
â”œâ”€â”€ CMakeLists.txt              # Builds viewer executable only
â”œâ”€â”€ GLFWApp.h/cpp               # Main viewer app
â”œâ”€â”€ main.cpp                    # Viewer entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ ShapeRenderer.h/cpp         # 3D rendering utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ GLfunctions.h/cpp           # OpenGL helper functions
â””â”€â”€ C3D_Reader.h/cpp            # Motion capture data reader
```

### `sim/` Directory - Simulation Core
```
sim/
â”œâ”€â”€ Character.h/cpp
â”œâ”€â”€ Muscle.h/cpp
â”œâ”€â”€ Environment.h/cpp
â”œâ”€â”€ UriResolver.h/cpp
â””â”€â”€ ... (core simulation files)
```

## Files Moved

### From `viewer/` â†’ `surgery/` (9 files total)
1. âœ… `SurgeryPanel.h` and `SurgeryPanel.cpp`
2. âœ… `SurgeryOperation.h` and `SurgeryOperation.cpp`
3. âœ… `SurgeryScript.h` and `SurgeryScript.cpp`
4. âœ… `PhysicalExam.h` and `PhysicalExam.cpp`
5. âœ… `physical_exam_main.cpp`
6. âœ… `surgery_main.cpp`

### From `sim/` â†’ `surgery/` (2 files)
1. âœ… `SurgeryExecutor.h` and `SurgeryExecutor.cpp`

**Total:** 11 files moved âœ…

## Build Configuration

### `surgery/CMakeLists.txt`
```cmake
# Surgery library (shared code)
add_library(surgery STATIC
    "SurgeryExecutor.h"
    "SurgeryExecutor.cpp"
    "SurgeryOperation.h"
    "SurgeryOperation.cpp"
    "SurgeryScript.h"
    "SurgeryScript.cpp"
    "SurgeryPanel.h"
    "SurgeryPanel.cpp"
)

# Physical Examination executable
add_executable(physical_exam
    "PhysicalExam.h"
    "PhysicalExam.cpp"
    "physical_exam_main.cpp"
    "../viewer/ShapeRenderer.h"
    "../viewer/ShapeRenderer.cpp"
    "../viewer/GLfunctions.h"
    "../viewer/GLfunctions.cpp"
    "SurgeryExecutor.h"
    "SurgeryExecutor.cpp"
    "SurgeryOperation.h"
    "SurgeryOperation.cpp"
    "SurgeryScript.h"
    "SurgeryScript.cpp"
    "SurgeryPanel.h"
    "SurgeryPanel.cpp"
)

# Surgery Tool executable (CLI-only)
add_executable(surgery_tool
    "surgery_main.cpp"
)
target_link_libraries(surgery_tool surgery ...)
```

## Build Results

```bash
$ micromamba run -n bidir ninja -C build/release physical_exam surgery_tool
âœ… physical_exam: 2.3M (surgery/physical_exam)
âœ… surgery_tool: 549K (surgery/surgery_tool)
âœ… No compilation errors
âœ… No linter errors
```

## Executables Location

Both executables are now built in the `surgery/` directory:
```
build/release/surgery/
â”œâ”€â”€ physical_exam       # 2.3M - GUI application with surgery panel
â””â”€â”€ surgery_tool        # 549K - CLI surgery script tool
```

## How to Use

### Physical Examination App
```bash
cd build/release/surgery
./physical_exam

# Press 'G' to toggle surgery panel
# All surgery operations available in the GUI
```

### Surgery Tool (CLI)
```bash
cd build/release/surgery
./surgery_tool --help
./surgery_tool --script ../../data/example_surgery.yaml
```

## Benefits of This Organization

### ðŸŽ¯ Clear Separation of Concerns
- **`surgery/`** - All surgery-related functionality (operations, scripts, GUI, CLI)
- **`viewer/`** - Pure visualization and rendering (no surgery logic)
- **`sim/`** - Core simulation engine (character, muscles, physics)

### ðŸ“¦ Self-Contained Surgery Module
- All surgery files in one directory
- Easy to find and maintain
- Clear module boundaries

### ðŸ”§ Flexible Build Options
- `surgery` library: Shared code
- `physical_exam`: Full GUI application
- `surgery_tool`: Lightweight CLI tool
- Both executables built from the same module

### ðŸš€ Better Development Workflow
- Surgery changes isolated to one directory
- Viewer remains clean and focused
- Easier to test and debug surgery features

## Code Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Include Paths in `PhysicalExam.h`
```cpp
// Before
#include "../sim/SurgeryExecutor.h"

// After
#include "SurgeryExecutor.h"
#include "SurgeryPanel.h"
```

### 2. Updated CMakeLists.txt Include Directories
```cmake
target_include_directories(physical_exam PRIVATE
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../sim
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../viewer
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../libs/imgui
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../libs/implot
)
```

### 3. Moved Build Target from `viewer/` to `surgery/`
- `physical_exam` now built in `surgery/CMakeLists.txt`
- `viewer/CMakeLists.txt` only builds `viewer` executable

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Build system configured correctly
- [x] All files moved to surgery/
- [x] Include paths updated
- [x] Build completes without errors
- [x] Both executables created in surgery/
- [ ] Functional test: Run `physical_exam` and test surgery panel
- [ ] Functional test: Run `surgery_tool` with a script
- [ ] Verify surgery operations work correctly

## Summary

âœ… **PhysicalExam successfully moved to `surgery/` directory**  
âœ… **All surgery-related code now in one cohesive module**  
âœ… **Both executables build successfully**  
âœ… **Clean separation between surgery, viewer, and simulation**  

The surgery module is now self-contained and all surgery-related functionality (GUI app, CLI tool, operations, scripts) is organized in the `surgery/` directory.
