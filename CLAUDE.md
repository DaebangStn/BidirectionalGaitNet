- before run the binary, check the micromamba environment is active. otherwise, use '/opt/miniconda3/bin/micromamba run -n bidir [command]' to run commands in the environment
- For interactive activation, first run: eval "$(/opt/miniconda3/bin/micromamba shell hook --shell zsh)" then: micromamba activate bidir
- You can build the release mode with 'ninja -C build/release'
- If you test ray_rollout.py, you must launch tmux window like debugging since rollout takes quite long time.
- If you should check the ppo output, run "python ppo/ppo_hierarchical.py"
- generate the png with the render command plot/render.sh
