# Noise Injection Configuration
# This file defines disturbance parameters for training robust policies

noise_injection:
  # Master enable/disable
  enabled: false

  # Position Noise: Perturbs joint angles (additive)
  position:
    enabled: false
    amplitude: 0.005  # radians - amount of angular perturbation per joint
    frequency: 0.25   # Hz - Perlin noise frequency (higher = more rapid changes)
    target_nodes: ["TalusR", "TalusL"]

  # Force Noise: Applies external forces to body nodes
  force:
    enabled: true
    amplitude: 40.0  # Newtons - magnitude of applied forces
    frequency: 0.25   # Hz - Perlin noise frequency for force variation
    target_nodes: ["TalusR", "TalusL"]


  # Activation Noise: Perturbs muscle activation levels
  activation:
    enabled: false
    amplitude: 0.1   # 0-1 range - amount of activation perturbation (10% of full range)
    frequency: 2.0   # Hz - Perlin noise frequency for activation variation
