# Surgery Directory Reorganization - Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully moved all surgery-related files to a dedicated `./surgery` directory to improve project organization and modularity.

## Changes Made

### New Directory Structure

```
BidirectionalGaitNet/
├── surgery/                    # NEW: Surgery module
│   ├── CMakeLists.txt         # Surgery library and tool build config
│   ├── SurgeryExecutor.h      # Base surgery operations (moved from sim/)
│   ├── SurgeryExecutor.cpp
│   ├── SurgeryOperation.h     # Surgery operation classes (moved from viewer/)
│   ├── SurgeryOperation.cpp
│   ├── SurgeryScript.h        # Surgery script handling (moved from viewer/)
│   ├── SurgeryScript.cpp
│   ├── SurgeryPanel.h         # GUI panel for surgery (moved from viewer/)
│   ├── SurgeryPanel.cpp
│   └── surgery_main.cpp       # CLI surgery tool (moved from viewer/)
├── viewer/
│   ├── PhysicalExam.h         # Updated includes
│   ├── PhysicalExam.cpp
│   └── CMakeLists.txt         # Updated to link surgery library
├── sim/
│   └── (SurgeryExecutor moved to surgery/)
└── CMakeLists.txt             # Added surgery subdirectory
```

### Files Moved

#### From `viewer/` to `surgery/`:
1. `SurgeryPanel.h` and `SurgeryPanel.cpp`
2. `SurgeryOperation.h` and `SurgeryOperation.cpp`
3. `SurgeryScript.h` and `SurgeryScript.cpp`
4. `surgery_main.cpp`

#### From `sim/` to `surgery/`:
1. `SurgeryExecutor.h` and `SurgeryExecutor.cpp`

### Build System Changes

#### `/surgery/CMakeLists.txt` (NEW)
```cmake
# Surgery library - shared by physical_exam and surgery_tool
add_library(surgery STATIC
    "SurgeryExecutor.h"
    "SurgeryExecutor.cpp"
    "SurgeryOperation.h"
    "SurgeryOperation.cpp"
    "SurgeryScript.h"
    "SurgeryScript.cpp"
    "SurgeryPanel.h"
    "SurgeryPanel.cpp"
)

# Surgery Tool executable (CLI-only)
add_executable(surgery_tool
    "surgery_main.cpp"
)
```

#### `/CMakeLists.txt`
- Added `add_subdirectory( surgery )`

#### `/viewer/CMakeLists.txt`
- Removed inline surgery source files
- Added `surgery` to `target_link_libraries`
- Added `include_directories(../surgery/)`

### Include Path Updates

#### `viewer/PhysicalExam.h`
```cpp
#include "SurgeryPanel.h"  // Now finds it via include_directories
```

#### `surgery/SurgeryPanel.h`
```cpp
#include "SurgeryExecutor.h"  // Same directory
#include "Character.h"         // Found via include_directories
#include "ShapeRenderer.h"     // Found via include_directories
```

#### `surgery/SurgeryExecutor.h`
```cpp
#include "Character.h"      // Found via include_directories
#include "DARTHelper.h"     // Found via include_directories
```

#### `surgery/surgery_main.cpp`
```cpp
#include "SurgeryExecutor.h"  // Same directory now
```

## Benefits

### ✅ Better Organization
- All surgery-related code is now in one place
- Clear separation between viewer, simulation, and surgery
- Easier to find and maintain surgery functionality

### ✅ Improved Modularity
- Surgery is now a proper library module
- Can be used independently by different executables
- Cleaner dependencies

### ✅ Simplified Build
- Surgery library built once, linked multiple times
- Faster incremental builds
- `physical_exam` and `surgery_tool` share the same surgery code

### ✅ Clearer Responsibilities
```
surgery/         - All surgery operations and UI
viewer/          - Visualization and physical examination
sim/             - Simulation and character logic
```

## Build Instructions

```bash
cd /home/geon/BidirectionalGaitNet/build/release
cmake ../..
make -j$(nproc)
```

This will build:
- **`libsurgery.a`** - Static surgery library
- **`physical_exam`** - GUI application (uses surgery library)
- **`surgery_tool`** - CLI tool (uses surgery library)

## Migration Checklist

- [x] Create `surgery/` directory
- [x] Move surgery files from `viewer/` to `surgery/`
- [x] Move `SurgeryExecutor` from `sim/` to `surgery/`
- [x] Create `surgery/CMakeLists.txt`
- [x] Update root `CMakeLists.txt`
- [x] Update `viewer/CMakeLists.txt`
- [x] Fix include paths in all affected files
- [x] Add proper include directories
- [x] Verify no linter errors
- [ ] Build and test

## Testing

### 1. Build Test
```bash
cd build/release
cmake ../..
make physical_exam surgery_tool -j$(nproc)
```

### 2. Functional Test - Physical Exam
```bash
./physical_exam
# 1. Load a character
# 2. Press 'G' to toggle surgery panel
# 3. Test surgery operations
```

### 3. Functional Test - Surgery Tool
```bash
./surgery_tool --help
./surgery_tool --script data/example_surgery.yaml
```

## File Statistics

| Category | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Surgery files in viewer/ | 7 files | 0 files |
| Surgery files in sim/ | 2 files | 0 files |
| Surgery files in surgery/ | 0 files | 9 files |
| Total surgery files | 9 files | 9 files |

## Dependencies

### Surgery Library
- **Depends on**: `sim` (Character, DARTHelper), `viewer` (ShapeRenderer)
- **Used by**: `physical_exam`, `surgery_tool`

### Dependency Graph
```
surgery_tool  ──┐
                ├──> surgery ──┐
physical_exam ──┘              ├──> sim
                               └──> viewer (ShapeRenderer only)
```

## Notes

- All surgery functionality remains unchanged
- Only file locations and build configuration changed
- Include paths simplified using CMake `include_directories`
- No changes to public APIs or functionality

## Future Enhancements

Consider further modularization:
- Move `ShapeRenderer` to its own library (reduce surgery -> viewer dependency)
- Create separate `surgery_gui` and `surgery_core` libraries
- Add unit tests for surgery operations
