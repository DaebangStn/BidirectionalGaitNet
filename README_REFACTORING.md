# Surgery Panel Refactoring - Quick Start

## 🎯 What Was Done

Successfully refactored surgery-related functionality from `PhysicalExam` into a separate `SurgeryPanel` class for better modularity.

## 📁 New Files

### viewer/SurgeryPanel.h
Header file for surgery UI and operations
- Inherits from `SurgeryExecutor`
- Provides GUI-specific overrides with cache invalidation
- Public getters for rendering state

### viewer/SurgeryPanel.cpp  
Implementation of surgery functionality
- All surgery UI sections (distribute, relax, anchor manipulation)
- Surgery script recording/loading
- Over 1,400 lines of focused surgery code

## 📝 Key Changes

### PhysicalExam
- **Before:** 4,828 lines (exam + surgery mixed)
- **After:** 3,591 lines (exam only)
- **Removed:** 1,237 lines of surgery code
- **Added:** `SurgeryPanel* mSurgeryPanel` member

### Benefits
✅ **Modularity** - Surgery and exam are separate  
✅ **Maintainability** - Smaller, focused files  
✅ **Reusability** - SurgeryPanel can be used independently  
✅ **Testability** - Surgery ops testable in isolation  

## 🚀 Build & Test

```bash
# Build
cd build/release
cmake ../..
make physical_exam -j$(nproc)

# Run
./physical_exam

# Test surgery panel
# 1. Load a character
# 2. Press 'G' to toggle surgery panel
# 3. Try surgery operations
```
