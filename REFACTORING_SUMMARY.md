# Surgery Panel Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Refactored surgery-related functionality from `PhysicalExam` into a separate `SurgeryPanel` class to enhance modularity.

## Changes Made

### New Files Created
1. **viewer/SurgeryPanel.h** - Header file for surgery UI and operations
2. **viewer/SurgeryPanel.cpp** - Implementation of surgery UI and operations

### Modified Files

#### viewer/PhysicalExam.h
- Removed inheritance from `SurgeryExecutor`
- Added `SurgeryPanel* mSurgeryPanel` member
- Removed surgery-related member variables:
  - `mSaveMuscleFilename`, `mSavingMuscle`
  - `mDistributeSelection`, `mDistributeRefMuscle`, `mDistributeFilterBuffer`
  - `mRelaxSelection`, `mRelaxFilterBuffer`
  - `mAnchorCandidateMuscle`, `mAnchorReferenceMuscle`
  - `mSelectedCandidateAnchorIndex`, `mSelectedReferenceAnchorIndex`
  - `mAnchorCandidateFilterBuffer`, `mAnchorReferenceFilterBuffer`
  - `mRecordingSurgery`, `mRecordedOperations`, `mRecordingScriptPath`
  - `mLoadScriptPath`, `mRecordingPathBuffer`, `mLoadPathBuffer`
  - `mLoadedScript`, `mShowScriptPreview`
- Removed surgery-related method declarations

#### viewer/PhysicalExam.cpp
- Updated constructor to initialize `mSurgeryPanel = nullptr`
- Updated destructor to delete `mSurgeryPanel`
- Updated `loadCharacter()` to create `SurgeryPanel` instance
- Updated `render()` to delegate to `mSurgeryPanel->drawSurgeryPanel()`
- **TODO:** Remove large blocks of surgery-related code (lines 1067-2182 and 4696-4816)

## Next Steps

### Remaining Work in PhysicalExam.cpp
The following surgery-related method implementations need to be removed:

**Block 1 (lines 1067-2182):**
- `drawSurgeryPanel()`
- `editAnchorPosition()`
- `editAnchorWeights()`
- `addBodyNodeToAnchor()`
- `removeBodyNodeFromAnchor()`
- `drawDistributePassiveForceSection()`
- `drawRelaxPassiveForceSection()`
- `drawSaveMuscleConfigSection()`
- `drawAnchorManipulationSection()`
- `removeAnchorFromMuscle()`
- `copyAnchorToMuscle()`

**Block 2 (lines 4696-4816+):**
- `startRecording()`
- `stopRecording()`
- `exportRecording()`
- `recordOperation()`
- `loadSurgeryScript()`
- `executeSurgeryScript()`
- `showScriptPreview()`

**Special Case: drawSelectedAnchors()**
This rendering method in `PhysicalExam` currently accesses surgery panel state variables.
Two options:
1. Move it to `SurgeryPanel` and make it public
2. Add getters to `SurgeryPanel` for the state variables

### CMakeLists.txt Updates
Add `viewer/SurgeryPanel.cpp` to the build system.

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Separation of Concerns** - Physical examination and surgery operations are now separate
2. **Modularity** - Surgery panel can be reused or modified independently
3. **Reduced Coupling** - PhysicalExam no longer depends on surgery implementation details
4. **Easier Maintenance** - Smaller, focused classes are easier to understand and modify
5. **Better Testability** - Surgery operations can be tested independently

## Architecture

```
PhysicalExam (UI for physical examination)
  ├── Character (simulation model)
  ├── ShapeRenderer (rendering)
  └── SurgeryPanel (surgery UI and operations)
       └── SurgeryExecutor (base surgery logic)
```

## Usage Example

```cpp
// Create physical exam
PhysicalExam exam(1920, 1080);
exam.initialize();

// Load character - automatically creates SurgeryPanel
exam.loadCharacter("skeleton.xml", "muscles.xml", ActuatorType::FORCE);

// Surgery panel is shown/hidden with 'G' key
// All surgery operations are now handled by mSurgeryPanel
```
