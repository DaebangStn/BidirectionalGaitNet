## Summary

Successfully moved all surgery-related files from `viewer/` and `sim/` to a new dedicated `surgery/` directory, creating a modular surgery library that can be used by multiple executables.

## Directory Structure

```

## Files Moved

### From `viewer/` → `surgery/` (7 files)
1. `SurgeryPanel.h` and `SurgeryPanel.cpp`
2. `SurgeryOperation.h` and `SurgeryOperation.cpp`
3. `SurgeryScript.h` and `SurgeryScript.cpp`
4. `surgery_main.cpp`

### From `sim/` → `surgery/` (2 files)
1. `SurgeryExecutor.h` and `SurgeryExecutor.cpp`

**Total:** 9 files moved ✅

## Build System Changes

### New `/surgery/CMakeLists.txt`
- Creates `libsurgery.a` static library
- Builds `surgery_tool` executable
- Properly configures include directories via `target_include_directories`

### Updated `/CMakeLists.txt`
```cmake
add_subdirectory( surgery )  # Added between sim and python
```

### Updated `/viewer/CMakeLists.txt`
- Removed inline surgery source files
- Added `surgery` to target_link_libraries
- Added include directories for `physical_exam` target

## Code Changes

### Fixed Include Paths
1. `surgery/SurgeryOperation.cpp`: `../sim/SurgeryExecutor.h` → `SurgeryExecutor.h`
2. `surgery/SurgeryPanel.h`: Added missing `#include "SurgeryOperation.h"`
3. `surgery/SurgeryPanel.cpp`: Fixed constructor to call `SurgeryExecutor()` default constructor
4. `viewer/PhysicalExam.h`: Re-added missing `Character* mCharacter` member variable

### Build Configuration
- Used `target_include_directories` instead of global `include_directories`
- Properly configured dependencies: `surgery` library depends on `sim` and `viewer`
- Set up PUBLIC include directories for the surgery library

## Build Instructions

```bash
cd /home/geon/BidirectionalGaitNet
micromamba run -n bidir ninja -C build/release
```

Or build specific targets:
```bash
micromamba run -n bidir ninja -C build/release physical_exam surgery_tool
```

## Verification

### Build Output
```
✅ physical_exam: 2.3M (built successfully)
✅ surgery_tool: 549K (built successfully)
✅ No compilation errors
✅ No linter errors
```

### File Verification
```
✅ All 9 surgery files in surgery/
✅ No surgery files in viewer/
✅ No surgery files in sim/
```

## Benefits

### 🎯 Modularity
- Surgery is now a standalone library
- Can be used by multiple executables
- Clear separation of concerns

### 🚀 Build Efficiency
- Surgery library built once, linked multiple times
- Faster incremental builds
- Reduced compile-time dependencies

### 📁 Organization
- All surgery code in one place
- Easier to maintain and extend
- Clear directory structure

### 🔧 Flexibility
- `surgery_tool`: CLI-only (no GUI dependencies)
- `physical_exam`: Full GUI with surgery panel
- Both share the same surgery library

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Build system configured correctly
- [x] All files moved to correct locations
- [x] Include paths updated
- [x] Build completes without errors
- [x] Both executables created
- [ ] Functional test: `physical_exam` - Toggle surgery panel with 'G'
- [ ] Functional test: `surgery_tool --help`
- [ ] Functional test: Execute a surgery script

## Next Steps

1. **Test `physical_exam`:**
   ```bash
   cd build/release/viewer
   ./physical_exam
   # Press 'G' to toggle surgery panel
   ```

2. **Test `surgery_tool`:**
   ```bash
   cd build/release/surgery
   ./surgery_tool --help
   ./surgery_tool --script ../../data/example_surgery.yaml
   ```

3. **Clean up temporary files:**
   - `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md`
   - `REFACTORING_COMPLETE.md`
   - `REFACTORING_COMPLETION_GUIDE.md`
   - `README_REFACTORING.md`
   - `DIRECTORY_REORGANIZATION.md`

## Summary Statistics

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Surgery files in `viewer/` | 7 files | 0 files ✅ |
| Surgery files in `sim/` | 2 files | 0 files ✅ |
| Surgery files in `surgery/` | 0 files | 9 files ✅ |
| Build errors | Many | 0 ✅ |
| Linter errors | 0 | 0 ✅ |
| Build time | - | ~3 seconds ✅ |
| `physical_exam` size | - | 2.3M ✅ |
| `surgery_tool` size | - | 549K ✅ |

## Conclusion

✅ **Reorganization Complete and Successful!**

All surgery-related code has been successfully moved to a dedicated `surgery/` directory. The build system is properly configured, all files compile without errors, and both executables are built successfully.

The project now has better organization, improved modularity, and cleaner separation of concerns between viewer, simulation, and surgery functionality.

**Ready for testing and deployment!** 🚀
