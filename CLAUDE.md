- You can build the release mode with 'ninja -C build/release -j 16'
- you must rebuild the executable after you made the change
- If you test ray_rollout.py, you must launch tmux window like debugging since rollout takes quite long time.
- If you should check the ppo output, run "python ppo/learn.py debug" it also takes much time.
- generate the png with the render command plot/render.sh do not manually run the dot command.
